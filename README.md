### About the Program

The Summer of Making program provides teenagers with the resources needed to make their large passion projects a reality for free. 

Every participant will be receiving their very own industry expert mentor to support them every step of the way. The participants will have weekly digital meetings with their mentor.

Hack Club will be giving you access to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of software development tools as part of the program. This will be done through our fast track lane for the Github Student Developer Pack. Do you need something else to make your project possible? Let us know in your application and we'll do our best to get it for you for you as well.

Once your project is complete, we'll promote your project through our channels as well as supporting you with your own marketing efforts to get the word out!

The program will be taking place this summer with the making stage being from June 21st to August 16th. Once the projects are completed they'll be showcased to the world.

Those who participate, will join an alumni of passionate makers like themselves and will make new found industry contacts. We're excited to see what you make, apply now and submit your idea before May 31.
